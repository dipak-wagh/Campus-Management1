# Campus Management System 

This is my Django-based project called Campus Management System, which I built to manage users, courses, and assignments in a college environment. 
I tried to cover the key features that are needed in a real campus system using Python and Django.


#Technologies Used

- Python
- Django (backend framework)
- SQLite (default Django DB)
- HTMl (frontend Structure)
- Django REST Framework (for APIs)



#Project Overview

The system supports three types of users:

- Admin– Can manage users, courses, and monitor activities
- Teacher – Can add assignments, view submissions, and grade students
- Student – Can enroll in courses and submit assignments
